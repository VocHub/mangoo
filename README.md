## Obs

I'm probably going to make a better version later as this one was done when I was just learning React

## Summary

This application is based on the idea of distributing mangas for free, unfortunately it's only (CC) content :c

## Commands

To run the current version you need to open your CLI and type the following:

-   Starts the app:
```
 npm start
```

- Mock JSON Backend (you can set it up by changing the db.json file, it has the basic-ish structure of my current db):
```
 npm run jserver
```

-   if for some odd reason my css isn't compiling, use this command to compile Sass once again:
```
 npm run compile:sass
```
